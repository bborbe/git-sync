<summary>
- All existing tests pass without failures
- Code compiles cleanly with no errors
- Linting and formatting pass
- The full precommit check succeeds end-to-end
- Definition of Done criteria are met (doc comments, error handling, test coverage)
</summary>

<objective>
Ensure the project is in a healthy state: all tests pass, code compiles, linting succeeds, and the Definition of Done is satisfied. Fix any issues found.
</objective>

<context>
Read CLAUDE.md for project conventions and build commands.
Read `docs/dod.md` for the Definition of Done criteria.
Run `make precommit` to identify any current failures.
</context>

<requirements>
1. Run `make precommit` and capture all failures
2. Fix any compilation errors
3. Fix any failing tests
4. Fix any linting or formatting issues
5. Review code against `docs/dod.md` criteria — fix any violations in files you touched
6. If you create new code to fix an issue, include tests
7. Run `make precommit` again to confirm all issues are resolved
</requirements>

<constraints>
- Do NOT commit — dark-factory handles git
- Do NOT refactor code unrelated to fixing failures
- Do NOT add new features — only fix what is broken
- Minimize changes — fix the root cause, not symptoms
</constraints>

Run `make precommit` — must pass with exit code 0.
